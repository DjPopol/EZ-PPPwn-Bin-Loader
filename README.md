# Usage
On your PS4:
- Go to `Settings` and then `Network`
- Select `Set Up Internet connection` and choose `Use a LAN Cable`
- Choose `Custom` setup and choose `PPPoE` for `IP Address Settings`
- Enter anything for `PPPoE User ID` and `PPPoE Password`
- Choose `Automatic` for `DNS Settings` and `MTU Settings`
- Choose `Do Not Use` for `Proxy Server`
- Click `Test Internet Connection` to communicate with your computer

If the exploit fails or the PS4 crashes, you can skip the internet setup and simply click on `Test Internet Connection`. If the `pppwn.exe` is stuck waiting for a request/response, cancel it and run it again on your computer, and then click on `Test Internet Connection` on your PS4.

If the exploit works, you should see an output similar to below, and you should see `Cannot connect to network.` followed by `PPPwned` printed on your PS4.
