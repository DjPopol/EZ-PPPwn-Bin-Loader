PPPwn is a kernel remote code execution exploit for PlayStation 4 up to FW 11.00. This is a proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2006-4304 that was reported responsibly to PlayStation.

Supported versions are:

    FW 8.50
    FW 9.00
    FW 9.03 / 9.04
    FW 9.50 / 9.60
    FW 10.00 / 10.01
    FW 10.50 / 10.70 / 10.71
    FW 11.00
    more can be added (PRs are welcome)

The exploit only prints PPPwned on your PS4 as a proof-of-concept. In order to launch Mira or similar homebrew enablers, the stage2.bin payload needs to be adapted.

    [ Firmware Playstation ]   : Choose Firmware version
    
    [ Stage1 ]
    - button "Browse"          : Browse stage1.bin
    
    [ Stage2 ]
    - button "Browse"          : Browse stage2.bin

    [ Command ]
    - button "Save Batch"      : Save Execute Batch script (.sh) as

    - button "Execute"         : Execute POC in new window "Console"

    Console :

On your PS4:

- Go to `Settings` and then `Network`
- Select `Set Up Internet connection` and choose `Use a LAN Cable`
- Choose `Custom` setup and choose `PPPoE` for `IP Address Settings`
- Enter anything for `PPPoE User ID` and `PPPoE Password`
- Choose `Automatic` for `DNS Settings` and `MTU Settings`
- Choose `Do Not Use` for `Proxy Server`
- Click `Test Internet Connection` to communicate with your computer

If the exploit fails or the PS4 crashes, you can skip the internet setup and simply click on `Test Internet Connection`. If the `pppwn.py` script is stuck waiting for a request/response, abort it and run it again on your computer, and then click on `Test Internet Connection` on your PS4.

If the exploit works, you should see an output similar to below, and you should see `Cannot connect to network.` followed by `PPPwned` printed on your PS4.
